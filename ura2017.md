The LAUNCHXL-F28377S is programmed using the Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE. 
The controllers for the Boost stage and the Inverter stage in the PLECS simulation were implemented and tested separately.


### DC-DC Boost Stage Performance

Picture above shows the input current which needs to follow the reference current. 
This was tested by using a fixed resistance at the DC Link Voltage, and impedance transforming the load. 
The reference current was used as one of the inputs to a hysteresis controller for a boost converter in order to make the input current the same.
More details to be added
