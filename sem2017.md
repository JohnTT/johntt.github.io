The UM ecoMotion team was created in January 2016 with little members, funding, or faculty support with the intent of competing in the Shell Eco-Marathon.
In the span of about 1.5 years, the team successfully designed, built and tested a prototype Battery Electric vehicle for the Americas 2017 competition.
We successfully passed the on-site technical inspection, and completed a valid run on the race track. It was a great opportunity to meet students from other
universities, and to see the results of months of hard work with the team.


### Embedded Systems
#### Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus

</a>

CAN Bus is an automotive protocol developed by Bosch which allows many devices to communicate over a single twisted pair cable.
For the 2017 design, we chose this protocol because many components, such as our motor controller and battery pack, already had CAN Bus capabilities, and as such it was the most convenient way to interface with them.
The picture above details some of the CAN messages broadcasted by the AllCell Battery Management System. 
AllCell follows the SAE J1939 standard for CAN Bus communications, where Extended IDs are used and certain bytes are reserved for Parameter Group Numbers (PGNs) which are used to group packets which carry similar data.


#### [Vedder BLDC Motor Controller](http://vedder.se/2014/01/a-custom-bldc-motor-controller/)

#### E-Paper Display

For this year's design, the team used an E-Paper Screen to display information to the driver. 
E-Paper Displays are really cool because the images displayed remain on the screen even if you turn off the power to the electronics.
Our team bought the screen and there was very little documentation or support online except for the included datasheet. 
I developed the library, with the help of Liam Sparling, for STM32 that allows you to write alphanumeric characters to the screen.
The E-Paper screen was used to display more complicated free-form information to the driver, such as information from the AllCell Battery Management System. 
One of the reasons for this is the relatively slow refresh rate of the screen.


### Web Development

The website was designed using the [Orane theme](http://demo.drupalexp.com/orane/) in the Drupal Content Management System. 
The appearance of the website was conceptualized by the team captain, James Harper, and I am responsible for the front-end implementation.


### Recruitment

I am responsible for recruitment and registration for the UM ecoMotion team throughout 2016-2018. 
The picture above provides some interesting statistics about the team members for this year.
The spreadsheet also contains the contact information of all active, registered members.


### Funding

I oversee the application to the Engineering Endowment Fund (EEF), one of the team's major sources of funding for each competition year. 
The team has been funded $14000 through the EEF so far, and we are very thankful to have them as a major sponsor.
